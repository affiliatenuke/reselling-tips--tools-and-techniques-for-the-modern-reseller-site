Most importantly, shipping scales are certified for trade use, meaning they meet accuracy standards required for commercial transactions.",

      {
        "answer": "Calibrate your scale monthly if you ship daily, or before each heavy shipping session if you ship less frequently. Always recalibrate after moving your scale or if you notice any accuracy drift. Use certified calibration weights or known reference items like a new ream of paper (5 lbs) or a gallon of water (8.34 lbs).",

If you choose a wireless model, keep fresh batteries on hand and replace them at the first sign of inconsistent weights.
