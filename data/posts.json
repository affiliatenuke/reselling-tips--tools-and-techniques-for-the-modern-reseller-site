    "content": "Running a reselling business without the right software is like trying to dig a hole with a spoon. You'll get there eventually, but you'll burn out long before you hit your goals.\nThe reseller software landscape has exploded over the past few years. Crosslisting tools like Vendoo and List Perfectly let you push inventory to multiple platforms with a single click. Inventory management apps keep your stock organized when you're juggling hundreds of SKUs. Pricing tools help you stay competitive without constantly checking sold comps.\nAnd then there's AI. Tools powered by ChatGPT, Claude, and other models are changing how resellers write titles, craft descriptions, and even research products to source. This isn't future talk — resellers are using these tools right now to list faster and sell more.\nBut here's the problem: there are dozens of options in each category, and most review sites just regurgitate feature lists without telling you what actually works.\nThat's what we do differently at ResaleEdge. We test these tools in real reselling operations and tell you which ones are worth your money and which ones are hype. Browse our reviews below or start with our top picks for each category.",
